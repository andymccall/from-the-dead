BIOS_SET_MESSAGE                = $C033

; Action: Enables or disables disc error messages
; Entry:  To enable messages, A holds $00; to disable messages, A
;         holds $FF
; Exit:   A holds  the  previous  state,  HL  and  the  flags are
;         corrupt, and all others are preserved
; Notes:  Enabling  and  disabling  the   messages  can  also  be
;         achieved by poking $BE78 with $00 or $FF

BIOS_SETUP_DISC                 = $C036

; Action: Sets the parameters which effect the disc speed
; Entry:  HL holds the address of  the  nine  bytes which make up
;         the parameter block
; Exit:   AF, BC, DE and HL are  corrupt, and all other registers
;         are preserved
; Notes:  The parameter block is arranged as follows:
;         bytes 0$1 -  the  motor  on  time  in  20ms  units; the
;         default is $0032; the fastest is $0023
;         bytes 2$3 -  the  motor  off  time  in  20ms units; the
;         default is $00FA; the fastest is $00C8
;         byte 4 - the write off  time in l0Ã¦s units; the default
;         is $AF; should not be changed
;         byte 5 - the head settle time in 1ms units; the default
;         is $0F; should not be changed
;         byte 6 - the step rate  time  in 1ms units; the default
;         is $0C; the fastest is $0A
;         byte 7 - the  head  unload  delay;  the default is $01;
;         should not be changed
;         byte 8  -  a  byte  of  $03  and  this  should  be left
;         unaltered

BIOS_SELECT_FORMAT              = $C039

; Action: Sets a format for a disc
; Entry:  A holds the type of format that is to be selected
; Exit:   AF, BC, DE  and  HL  are  corrupt,  and  all  the other
;         registers are preserved
; Notes:  To select one of the normal disc formats, the following
;         values should be put into the A register:
;         Data format - $C1
;         System format - $41 - Used by CP/M
;         IBM format - $01 - compatible with CP/M-86
;         This routine sets  the  extended  disc  parameter block
;         (XDPB) at $A890 to $A8A8  -  to  set other formats, the
;         XDPB must be altered directly

BIOS_READ_SECTOR                = $C03C

; Action: Reads a sector from a disc into memory
; Entry:  HL holds the address in memory where the sector will be
;         read to, E holds the drive number ($00 for drive A, and
;         $01 for drive B), D holds the track number, and C holds
;         the sector number
; Exit:   If the sector was read properly,  then Carry is true, A
;         holds 0, and HL is preserved;  if the read failed, then
;         Carry is false, A  holds  an  error  number,  and HL is
;         corrupt; in either case,  the  other flags are corrupt,
;         and all other registers are preserved

BIOS_WRITE_SECTOR                   = $C03F

; Action: Writes a sector from memory onto disc
; Entry:  HL holds the address of memory which will be written to
;         the disc, E holds the  drive  number  ($00 for drive A,
;         and $01 for drive B), D  holds  the track number, and C
;         holds the sector number
; Exit:   If the sector was written properly, then Carry is true,
;         A holds 0, and HL  is  preserved;  if the write failed,
;         then Carry is false, A holds an error number, and HL is
;         corrupt; in either case,  the  other flags are corrupt,
;         and all other registers are preserved

BIOS_FORMAT_TRACK               = $C042

; Action: Formats a complete  track,  inserts  sectors, and fills
;         the track with bytes of $E5
; Entry:  HL contains  the  address  of  the  header  information
;         buffer which holds  the  header  information  blocks, E
;         contains the drive number ($00 for drive A, and $01 for
;         drive B), and D holds the track number
; Exit:   if the formatting process was successful, then Carry is
;         true, A holds 0, and HL is preserved; if the formatting
;         process failed, then Carry is  false,  A holds an error
;         number, and HL is  corrupt;  in  either case, the other
;         flags are corrupt,  and  all  the  other  registers are
;         preserved
; Notes:  The header information block is laid out as follows:
;         byte 0 - holds the track number
;         byte 1 - holds the head number (set to zero)
;         byte 2 - holds the sector number
;         byte 3 - holds  log2(sector  size) -7  (usually  either
;         $02=512 bytes, or $03=1024  bytes).  Header information
;         blocks must be set up  contiguously for every sector on
;         the track, and in the same sequence that they are to be
;         laid down (eg $C1, $C6,  $C2,  $C7, $C3, $C8, $C4, $C9,
;         $C5)

BIOS_MOVE_TRACK                 = $C045

; Action: Moves the disc drive head to the specified track
; Entry:  E holds the drive number ($00  for drive A, and $01 for
;         drive B), and D holds the track number
; Exit:   If the head was moved successfully, then Carry is true,
;         A holds 0, and  HL  is  preserved;  if the move failed,
;         then Carry is false, A holds an error number, and HL is
;         corrupt; in both cases,  the  other  flags are corrupt,
;         and all other registers are preserved
; Notes:  There is normally no need to  call this routine as READ
;         SECTOR, WRITE  SECTOR  and  FORMAT  TRACK automatically
;         move the head to the correct position

BIOS_GET_STATUS                 = $C048

; Action: Returns the status of the specified drive
; Entry:  A holds the drive number ($00  for drive A, and $01 for
;         drive B)
; Exit:   If Carry is true, then A  holds the status byte, and HL
;         is preserved; if Carry is false, then A is corrupt, and
;         HL holds the  address  of  the  byte  before the status
;         byte; in either case,  the  other  flags are preserved,
;         and all other registers are preserved
; Notes:  The  status  byte  indicates   the  drive's  status  as
;         follows:
;         if bit 6 is set, then  either  the write protect is set
;         or the disc is missing
;         if bit 5 is set, then  the  drive is ready and the disc
;         is fitted (whether the disc is formatted or not)
;         if bit 4 is set, then the head is at track 0

BIOS_SET_RETRY_COUNT            = $C04B

; Action: Sets the number of  times  the  operation is retried in
;         the event of disc error
; Entry:  A holds the number of retries required
; Exit:   A holds the  previous  number  of  retries,  HL and the
;         flags are corrupt, and all others are preserved
; Notes:  The default setting is $10,  and the minimum setting is
;         $01; the number  of  retries  can  also  be  altered by
;         poking $BE66 with the required value

GET_SECTOR_DATA             = $C56C
; Action: Gets the data of a sector on the current track
; Entry:  E holds the drive number
; Exit:   If a formatted disc is present, then Carry is true, and
;         HL is preserved; if an  unforrnatted disc is present or
;         the disc is missing, then Carry  is false, and HL holds
;         the address of  the  byte  before  the  status byte; in
;         either case, A and the other flags are corrupt, and all
;         other registers are preserved
; Notes:  The track number is held  at  $BE4F, the head number is
;         held at $BE50, the sector number  is held at $BE51, and
;         the log2(sector size)-7 is  held  at  $BE52; disc para-
;         meters do not need to be set to the format of the disc;
;         this routine is best used  with the disc error messages
;         turned off
