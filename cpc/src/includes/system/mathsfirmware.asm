; &BDC1   MOVE REAL (&BD3D for the 464)
;       Action: Copies the five bytes that are  pointed to by DE to the
;               location held in HL
;       Entry:  DE points to the source  real  value,  and HL points to
;               the destination
;       Exit:   HL points to the real  value  in the destination, Carry
;               is true if the move  went  properly,  F is corrupt, and
;               all other registers are preserved
;       Notes:  For the 464 only, A holds the exponent byte of the real
;               value when the routine is exited

;               the other flags are  corrupt,  and  all other registers
;               are preserved

;       Notes:  This rounds the decimal part  down  if  it is less than
