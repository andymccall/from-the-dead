In a world ravaged by an undead apocalypse, humanity teeters on the brink of extinction, a hardened survivor named Tyler must escort a young girl named Alexia across the treacherous landscape. Their journey is fraught with danger, as they face not only the infected - grotesque, mutated undead driven by an insatiable hunger - but also desperate survivors willing to do anything to stay alive.

With limited resources and a constant threat lurking around every corner, Tyler and Alexia must rely on their wits, survival skills, and each other to navigate this unforgiving world.
